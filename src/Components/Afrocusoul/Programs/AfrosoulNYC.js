            Afrosoul NYC Experience is a media  platform where we can talk about  
            culture itself, self identity, matters  of the Performing Arts  
            throughout the African diaspora with a  focus on the integration of 
            art and socialization with a core principle that the arts are not a 
            luxury but a civic necessity.
