                    I am an advocate of women's wellbeing, Cuban culture, the African Diaspora, 
                    and my own dance forms and style. As a performing artist- Afro Cuban young woman 
                    living in NYC for a while now,  I am coming from a long line of  artistic family 
                    descendants of Spanish and French but most importantly Africa the motherland.  
                    I am proud to  advocate and defend furiously my roots, my culture, my dance and  
                    black women who need to be represented and have their voices be heard  in our 
                    society and individually and as a community.
