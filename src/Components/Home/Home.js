                <h3>The power of creative Art </h3>
                Movement has healing properties  in general, dance  
                has been known to heal people mentally, spiritually,  in some cases  physically.  
                According to an article published last year by Shannon Sexton, “ Dancing can boost mood, 
                self-esteem, and fitness levels; reduce stress and even help us recover from trauma. “ 
                I would like to offer a space where movement can help  humanity in an artistic, holistic  
                form.
